# `cursor-core`

A crate to interact with Cursor server and process the model result.

## Wait, where is the source code?

Currently, there is no plans to open-source this crate.

Since Cursor doesn't provide any public API for other apps, this crate could potentially expose their server to misuse or abuse. You can still build and contribute to other parts of the extension, without the source code of this crate.
